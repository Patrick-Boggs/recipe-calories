Goal
Migrate the app to Material UI (MUI) with a mobile-first AppBar layout that establishes clear navigation and layout structure, without adding new features yet.

This is a UI/UX scaffolding pass, not a feature expansion.


High-level intent
- Introduce a persistent AppBar as the primary navigation anchor.
- Separate navigation, recipe identity, and recipe content into clear layout regions.
- Prepare the app structure for:
  - a Favorites screen (separate route/view)
  - multiple recipe views (Analyze vs Cook)
- Preserve existing functionality and logic as much as possible.


Step 1: Add MUI and baseline theme
- Install @mui/material, @mui/icons-material, and @emotion/react / styled.
- Wrap the app in ThemeProvider with MUI’s default light theme.
- Do minimal theming only:
  - primary color
  - default typography scale
- Avoid custom CSS overrides unless absolutely necessary.


Step 2: Introduce AppBar as the top-level layout anchor
- Replace the current header/title area with an MUI AppBar.
- Mobile-first design:
  - AppBar contains:
    - App title (“Recipe Calories”) or current recipe title (later)
    - Right-side icon button for Favorites
  - No tabs, drawers, or secondary nav yet.
- AppBar should be persistent across views.

This AppBar establishes the mental model:
“This is an app, not a single screen.”


Step 3: Establish two top-level views (no routing complexity yet)
Use simple state-based navigation initially:
- view = "recipe" (default)
- view = "favorites"

When Favorites icon is tapped:
- switch view to "favorites"
- show a back arrow in the AppBar
- back arrow returns to "recipe"

React Router can be added later once structure stabilizes.


Step 4: Refactor the Recipe screen into vertical sections
Under the AppBar, create one scrollable column using MUI layout primitives (Container, Stack, Box).

Divide the recipe screen into three conceptual sections:

1. Acquisition section
- URL input + Analyze button
- Use an MUI Card
- Keep it compact
- Later: collapse or de-emphasize after a recipe loads

2. Recipe identity section
- Title
- Servings
- Total kcal / per serving
- Favorite toggle icon (inactive for now or wired to state)
- Implement as a distinct Card
- This section should feel stable and important

3. Recipe content section
- Placeholder container for now
- Initially render the existing ingredient breakdown inside it
- This container is where Analyze vs Cook mode will swap content later

Do not redesign ingredient cards yet — just adapt spacing so they sit comfortably inside MUI layout.


Step 5: Create the Favorites screen scaffold
- Build a new FavoritesView component.
- Render a vertical list of MUI Cards:
  - placeholder data is fine
  - focus on spacing and tap targets
- Clicking a card:
  - sets currentRecipe
  - switches back to view = "recipe"

No persistence logic required yet — structure only.


Step 6: Defer everything else intentionally
Explicitly do not implement yet:
- Cooking mode
- Persistent favorites storage
- Routing
- Desktop-specific layouts
- Visual polish beyond MUI defaults

The goal is to lock in structure, not completeness.


Success criteria
- The app feels usable on mobile without scrolling confusion.
- It’s obvious where Favorites live and how you return.
- You can clearly point to where cooking mode would render without redesign.
- Adding a new top-level screen no longer feels scary.
